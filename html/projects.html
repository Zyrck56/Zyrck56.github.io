            <h3>Spring 2013</h3>
            <p>I purchase my own 
                <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/998">
                    Raspberry Pi 1 Model B</a>, successfully install 
                Raspbian, a lightweight Linux distro, and start learning about 
                GPIO hardware and software. I familiarize myself with basic 
                electronic hobbyist fundamentals (V = IR, PWM, DC Motors, 
                Stepper Motors, Sensors, etc). I also enroll in 
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python">Codecadamy's 
                    Python course</a>, Python being the language of choice when 
                programming the Pi. At this point, getting an LED blinking is a 
                huge accomplishment. 
            </p>
            <h3>Summer 2013</h3>
            <p>With my new knowledge (and time) I design and create a fully 
                operational wireless treaded-vehicle centered around the 
                Raspberry Pi (commonly referred to as a "Pi-Bot"). I control it 
                with keyboard input from my computer which broadcasts to the 
                Raspberry Pi through Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent, 
                as I can program the vehicle on-the-go via SSH, as well as 
                operate the vehicle anywhere throughout my entire house from my 
                computer, contrast to a typical robot IR receiver, which 
                requires line of sight.

            <h3>Spring 2014</h3>
            <p>I enter into a Microcontroller and Network Applications directed 
                study led by 
                <a href="http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~rinker/">Dr. Rinker</a>, 
                the Computer Science's department MCU 
                expert. I am part of a team of three who's goal is to transmit 
                flight controls to a quadcopter with wireless communication 
                provided by Xbee transmitters shielded to Arduino Unos, instead 
                of standard remote control (pictured). I complete the tasks of 
                setting up a wireless network between Xbee modules, translating 
                C-code into Arduino C, and writing data packing and unpacking 
                algorithms to prepare them for reception and interpretation. I 
                find that writing code is much easier than piloting a 
                quadcopter.

            <h3>Summer 2014</h3>
            <p>I now know how much room for improvement there is with my Pi-Bot. 
                Instead of an on-board Raspberry Pi, I now use an Arduino, which 
                is controlled by the Raspberry Pi through the Xbee network I set 
                up the previous semester. With the Pi as the controller, I 
                implement a neat library I found online, which allows me to use 
                an Xbox 360 controller as the input.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>My bot is now much more mobile (I can leave my house with it), 
                and I free up my Pi to use with other projects. Mechanical 
                improvements are made to the bot, including a bulldozer blade, 
                and articulating wheels to assist in crawling over objects.

            </p>
            <p>Now I am satisfied with my creation, but summer is only half way 
                over. With Siri for the iPhone gaining a lot of popularity, I'm 
                interested in how a computer understands and processes human 
                language. I find a project currently in development, called 
                <a href="http://jasperproject.github.io/">Jasper</a>. 
                Jasper is great not only because it is built for the 
                Raspberry Pi and is written in my now fluent Python, but also 
                shares a name with my beloved cat. At the time, Jasper provided 
                a skeleton layout for a question and answer Artificial 
                Intelligence, very similar to Siri. However, it is limited in 
                many ways. The questions it can answer are few, the speech 
                output sounds like Microsoft Sam from 2001, and there was almost 
                no personalization, a huge part of Siri's popularity. I purchase 
                a good microphone, and extend Jasper with intelligent query 
                processing algorithms, accurate speech-to-text conversion 
                through AT&T's API, and realistic text-to-speech output with 
                Google's services. ​You can view the changes I made on 
                <a href="https://github.com/Zyrck56/jasper">Github</a>.

            <h3>Winter 2015</h3>
            <p>A brief introduction to Java during Programming Languages my 
                sophomore year sparked my interest in that particular language. 
                I know it is a powerful and popular language, and I want to be 
                fluent. I see a post exclaiming that the latest version of 
                <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">
                Android Studio</a> had just been released, and I know this is 
                the time to get involved. I purchase 
                <a 
                 href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/">
                Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide﻿﻿</a> based off 
                of good reviews on Amazon.com, and 
                start working through it. The idea I have is an application that 
                alerts you via push notification when your club card is drawn at 
                my local favorite bar. This can be accomplished because the card 
                numbers are drawn and then posted on the bar's Twitter page 
                (the problem is that if your not diligent about checking your 
                Twitter, you could easily miss it). While creating the 
                user-interface is relatively easy, getting the application to 
                behave correctly at the system level presents quite a challenge. 
                The whole premise of the app is a one-and-done method of simply 
                entering you and your friends club card numbers, and then 
                forgetting about it until the app alerted you. I face issues 
                including making sure the app continued to run after the user 
                exited the application, and at regularly scheduled intervals. 
                The application also has to start when the device booted, so if 
                you restart your phone the application would continue to 
                function as expected. Luckily Twitter has a great 
                <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">API</a>, and so 
                ripping the numbers from the Twitter Feed is not too difficult. 
                I also get some real-world experience using regular expressions 
                to parse the numbers from any other irrelevant information that 
                might be included in the tweet. As break is wrapping up, I have 
                just enough time to look into concurrent processes on the 
                Android OS, and am able to minimize the resources the 
                application requires. I go back to school with my app 
                installed... and lo and behold a few weeks later the push 
                notification showed up: "Congratulations! It's your club card 
                day!". I check the twitter page to confirm, and there is my 
                number! Verifying the functionality of the app was awesome, and 
                the icing on the cake was me heading down to the bar to collect 
                my free drinks!

            <h3>Spring 2015</h3>
            <p>I am enrolled in Software Engineering, and am pleasantly 
                surprised to learn our semester project is a 2-dimensional 
                dungeon-crawling RPG, to be written in Java! It appears my 
                efforts over winter break have paid off. I easily contribute my 
                share of the project, and learn a lot about github and version 
                control. I am also enrolled in Introduction to Game Development, 
                where I am able to use my experience with Android to port my 
                final project, a video game similar to 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a>, 
                over to my phone. 
                Based off my classmates presentations, I believe I am the only 
                one to install their game on a mobile operating system.
